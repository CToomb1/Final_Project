# 5-DayFoodcast
This project is a 5 day forecast with suggested recipes based on the weather (i.e. rain, snow, sun, or overcast conditions).<lb>
We set the APIs to work in the order of the weather pulls from location and the recipes pull from the weather.<lb>
We have the header at the top of the page showing the title, and location search bar.<lb>
Below that would show the forecast of the next 5 days, including the date, weather icon, and temperature for that day.<lb>
Below each forecast would show meal recommendations for each day with a picture of suggested food, prep time, and a calorie count below that.<lb>
We started the project by building a basic html, adding to it gradually while our vision for our website evolved.<lb>
From there we woerked on the javascript, using a similar javascript that we used for the weather dashboard to creatre our first API and then added a second API to be able to pull recipes to be used for different weather patterns.<lb>
Added js improvements to make certain food items appear with a picture, prep time, and serving size for people.<lb>
As the project evolved we changed it from the weather affecting what people ate each day and changed it to be what people could eath throughout the week.<lb>
Where the whether for the week could determine what type of meals to be had that week (american cuisine, chinese cuisine, italian cuisine, etc.) so that by looking at Foodcast they could go forward from there. <lb>
Choosing ingredients to shop for based on what the foodcast predicts for that week. <lb>
We worked on our CSS last, making sure our website worked before designing it.<lb>
The API works when searching US CITIES!
